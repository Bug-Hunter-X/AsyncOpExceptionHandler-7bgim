# Unhandled Exception in Asynchronous Operation

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart asynchronous programming: insufficient error handling in `async` functions.  The provided `fetchData` function makes a network request. While it includes a `try-catch` block, the error handling is inadequate. The `catch` block simply prints a generic error message without providing details crucial for debugging or informative user feedback.

## Problem

The `catch` block only prints the exception object without providing context or additional information. This makes it difficult to identify and resolve the root cause of the error, especially in production environments. This can lead to poor user experience and complicate debugging processes.

## Solution

The solution involves enhancing the error handling within the `catch` block. This includes:

1.  **Logging Detailed Information:**  Use a logging library (or `print` with more context) to log the exception, stack trace, request details (URL, headers), and the response status code.
2.  **Providing Meaningful User Feedback:** Instead of a generic error message, provide user-friendly messages reflecting the nature of the error, without revealing sensitive information.
3.  **Custom Exception Handling:**  Create custom exception types to categorize errors and handle them differently based on their type. 
4.  **Retry Mechanism:** For transient network errors, implement a retry mechanism with exponential backoff.

The solution demonstrates best practices for robust asynchronous operation handling in Dart.
